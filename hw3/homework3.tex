% Problem 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}[Connecting Bayesian and Frequentist Approaches]
  
  In this question, we will gain practice with Bayesian modeling and
  compare it with the frequentist paradigm.
  
  In class, we discussed \emph{Normal-Normal conjugacy.} Now
  we will turn to \emph{Beta-Binomial conjugacy.} This model can be
  visualized in the following way.
  
  You observe a fixed number \(N\) of coin flips (either
  heads or tails) of which \(Y\) (a random variable) are heads. You assume that these are
  drawn by flipping a coin with an unknown probability \(\theta\) of
  landing heads. That is, we choose a \textbf{Binomial likelihood}
  \(Y \sim \mathrm{Bin}(N, \theta)\). The PMF of this distribution is
  given by
  
  \[
  p(Y=y) = {N \choose y} \theta^{y} (1-\theta)^{N-y}.
  \]
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item[1.]
    \textbf{Frequentist paradigm and MLE.} The (log) likelihood is all we
    need for frequentist inference. Derive the MLE estimate for \(\theta\)
    given the observations \(Y = y\). That is, find
    \(\arg \max_{\theta} \log p(Y = y \mid \theta)\).
  
  \item[2.]
    \textbf{Beta-Binomial conjugacy.} Under the Bayesian paradigm, we must specify a
    prior distribution for the unknown parameter \(\theta\). We choose a \textbf{Beta prior}
    \(\theta \sim \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)\). The PDF of this
    distribution is given by
    
    \[
    p(\theta) \propto \theta^{\alpha - 1} (1-\theta)^{\beta - 1}.
    \]
    
    When the prior and posterior belong to the same distribution family, we
    call the prior-and-likelihood pair a \textbf{conjugate pair.}
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Derive the mean, mode, and variance of the Beta distribution. That is, for $\theta \sim \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$, derive
      
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mean[\theta]$. See hint. \footnote{As an alternative to taking the integral, you may want to use
        \emph{reasoning by representation.} See example 8.5.2 of the Stat 110
        textbook. If you do so, please explain the derivation in your own
        words!}
        \item $\arg \max_{\theta} p(\theta)$ when $\alpha > 1$ and $\beta > 1$. What happens otherwise? (Consider $p(0)$ and $p(1)$.)
        \item $\mathrm{Var}(\theta) = \mean[\theta^2] - (\mean[\theta])^2$.
      \end{enumerate}

      Qualitatively speaking, what does this distribution look like for different $\alpha$ and $\beta$? You can either plot this yourself or see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution}{its Wikipedia page} after deriving the statistics above. What does $\mathrm{Beta}(1, 1)$ correspond to?

      \item 
      Show that the posterior
      \(p(\theta \mid Y=y)\) is indeed Beta and derive its parameters. This proves that a Beta prior and a Binomial likelihood form a conjugate pair; in other words, the Beta distribution is a \textbf{conjugate prior} for the Binomial distribution. See hint.\footnote{For convenience in calculation: Do you need to calculate the normalizing constant? Reuse your results from the previous part.}
    \end{enumerate}
  
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{framed}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[3.]
    \textbf{Posterior mean and mode.} Often we wish to work with just a
    single point estimate of the posterior. Two commonly used point
    estimates are the \emph{posterior mean} and the \emph{posterior mode}
    (a.k.a. the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate).
  
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using posterior point
      estimates. Which of these are relevant for our Beta-Binomial conjugate pair? Consider the case when $\alpha, \beta < 1$.
    
    \item
      Using your results from part 2, write down
      
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item the posterior mean estimate \(\theta_{\text{post mean}} = \mean [\theta \mid Y = y]\),
        \item the posterior MAP estimate \(\theta_{\text{MAP}}=\arg \max_{\theta}p(\theta \mid Y=y)\),
        \item and the posterior variance $\mathrm{Var}(\theta \mid Y = y) = \mean[\theta^2 \mid Y = y] - (\mean[\theta \mid Y = y])^2$.
      \end{enumerate}
      
      You shouldn't need any further derivations. That's the nice thing about conjugate priors!
      
    \end{enumerate}

\item[4.]
    \textbf{Prior-posterior connections.}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Explain in your own words how \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) affect the
      MAP estimate. How would you set \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) to reflect
      a prior belief that the coin is fair (i.e.~shows heads and tails
      with equal probability)? (Be careful! See 2.a.ii.)

    \item Now let's analyze the variances of our prior and posterior distributions. Consider the case when $\alpha = \beta$. (If you'd enjoy it, consider the general case for a better understanding.) A sentence or two for each point is fine.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item How does the variance of the prior relate to the variance of the posterior?
      \item How might you use the prior variance to encode a stronger or weaker prior belief?
      \item How does the posterior variance change as we observe more samples $n$?
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item[5.]
    \textbf{Analysis and connection to frequentism.}
  
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      Write a loss function \(\ell(\theta) \in \mathbb{R}\) in terms of
      \(\theta, y, n, \alpha, \beta\) such that minimizing \(\ell\) is
      equivalent to calculating the MAP estimate,
      i.e.~\(\theta_{\text{MAP}} = \arg \min_{\theta} \ell(\theta)\). Your
      function should be a sum of:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item a mean-squared-error term (which should loosely resemble $(y - \hat y)^2$)
        \item a
        regularization term \(g(\theta) = - a \theta + b \theta^{2}\) for some $a, b$.
      \end{enumerate}
      
      Can you interpret the regularization term? 
      
      Hint: Work backwards from part 1 to derive the MSE term and from part 2.a.ii to get the regularization term. Watch out for the signs! For the interpretation, complete the square and then compare your expression with the prior mode you found in 2.a.ii.
    \item
      What happens to both $\theta_{\text{post mean}}$ and $\theta_{\text{MAP}}$ as \(n \to \infty\)? Compare this to the MLE estimate.
      (Remember to account for the change in \(y\).)
    \end{enumerate}
  
\end{enumerate}

\end{framed}

\newpage
\subsection*{Solution:}
\question{1.1}{Frequentist paradigm and MLE.} 
Deriving the MLE for a Binomial is very similar to finding the MLE for the Bernoulli (since the two are very related):

\begin{align*}
  log p(Y=y | \theta) &\propto ylog(\theta) + (N-y)log(1-\theta) \\
  \frac{d}{d\theta}log p(Y=y | \theta) &\propto \frac{y}{\theta} - \frac{N-y}{1-\theta} = 0 \\
  \Rightarrow \hat{\theta}_{MLE} &= \frac{y}{N}
\end{align*}

TODO: do I need to check the second derivative to show that the function is convex?

\question{1.2}{Beta-binomial conjugacy.} 
TODO

\part{a(i)} From the story of the beta distribution (STAT110), we know that the parameters can be interpreted as the number of successes and the number of failures. Thus, we see that the mean (aka the average number of successes) a $\Beta(\alpha, \beta)$ is $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$.

\part{a(ii)} We compute, when $\alpha>1, \beta>1$:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{d\theta} p(\theta) &= (\alpha-1) \theta^{\alpha-2} (1-\theta)^{\beta-1} - \theta^{\alpha-1} (\beta-1)(1-\theta)^{\beta-2}=0 \quad \text{by product rule}\\
  &= \theta^{\alpha-2} (1-\theta)^{\beta-2} \left((\alpha-1)(1-\theta) - \theta(\beta-1)\right) \\
  \Rightarrow \text{arg max}_{\theta} p(\theta) &= (\alpha-1)(1-\theta) - \theta(\beta-1) = \alpha-1+\alpha - \alpha\theta - \theta\beta + \theta \\
  &= \theta(-\alpha+1-\beta+1) + (\alpha-1) \\
  \Rightarrow \hat{\theta}_{MLE} &= \frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+\beta-2}
\end{align*}

If $\alpha<1$ or $\beta<1$ then the distribution is convex so there isn't a unique or finite mode; the PDF goes to infinity as $\theta \rightarrow 0$ and $\theta \rightarrow 1$. TODO: add?

TODO: do I need to check the second derivative to show that the function is convex?

\part{a(iii)} We compute the variance as follows: TODO: why do I find variance particularly difficult? It's always the $\mean[\theta^2]$ bit that I find difficult.

TODO: do the derivation
\begin{align*}
  \Var(\theta) &= \mean[\theta^2] - (\mean[\theta])^2 \quad \text{by def var} \\
  &= \frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^2(\alpha+\beta-1)}
\end{align*}



\part{a cont'd} The distribution $\Beta(1,1) = \Unif(0,1)$, because when $\alpha=\beta=1$ the PDF becomes constant (no dependence on $\theta$). The beta distribution is remarkably flexible depending on the setting of its two hyperparameters. TODO: add?

\part{b} Here we show that the posterior is a $\Beta(\alpha+y, \beta+N-y)$:

\begin{align*}
  p(\theta|Y) &\propto \theta^y(1-\theta)^{N-y} \theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1} \\
  &= \theta^{y+\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta+N-y-1}
\end{align*}

Since the support for $\theta$ is $[0,1]$, we see that this matches the PDF for a Beta distribution where the update rule is $\alpha_N = \alpha+y$ and $\beta_N = \beta+N-y$.

\question{1.3}{Posterior mean and mode.} 
TODO

\part{a} Advantages: point estimates are easy to interpret, and are a single number. This can make them easy to work with, too.

Disadvantages: when we summarize a posterior distribution with a point estimate, we lose tons of information. Using a distribution instead of a single number lets us account for uncertainties and the randomness inherent to the process.

\part{b}

\begin{align*}
  \theta_{\text{post mean}} = \mean[\theta|Y=y] &= \frac{\alpha+y}{\alpha+\beta+N} \\
  \theta_{\text{MAP}} = \text{arg max}_{\theta} p(\theta|Y=y) &= \frac{\alpha_N-1}{\alpha_N+\beta_N-2} = \frac{\alpha+y-1}{\alpha+\beta+N-2} \\
  \Var(\theta|Y=y) &= \frac{\alpha_N\beta_N}{(\alpha_N+\beta_N)^2(\alpha_N+\beta_N-1)} = \frac{(\alpha+y)(\beta+N-y)}{(\alpha+\beta+N)^2(\alpha+\beta+N-1)}
\end{align*}

\question{1.4}{Prior-posterior connections.} 
TODO

\part{a} The larger $\alpha$ is, the stronger our prior belief is that 1 occurs more than 0, so our MAP moves towards 1. On the other hand, as $\beta \to \infty$, $\theta_{MAP} \to 0$. To reflect a prior belief that the coin is fair, then we can set $\alpha=\beta>1$. TODO: why do I need to be careful of 2.a.ii?

\part{b.i} The variance of the prior is larger than the variance of the posterior, because we are adding data. TODO: how to show computationally?

\part{b.ii} To encode a weaker belief, we can choose parameters of $\alpha, \beta$ to make the prior variance larger. This basically shows that we are less certain in our belief.

\part{b.iii} As $N\to\infty$, the posterior variance goes to 0 because we have a $N^3$ term in the bottom and a $N$ in the numerator. This makes sense, because if we had infinite data we expect our variance to shrink to 0.


\question{1.5}{Analysis and connection to frequentism.} 
TODO: OH.

\part{a} We write a loss function s.t. minimizing $\ell$ is equivalent to calculating the MAP estimate. Specifically, we write:

\begin{align*}
  \ell(\theta|y, n, \alpha, \beta) = TODO.
\end{align*}

\part{b} As $N \to \infty$, the posterior mean and the MAP both go to the MLE, which is $\frac{y}{N}$. This occurs because the constant terms (e.g. $\alpha, \beta$) will drop out. This makes sense, because if we have infinite data then the prior shouldn't affect the outcome at all.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{problem}[Neural Networks]

    In this problem, we will take a closer look at how gradients are calculated for backprop with a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP will consist of a first fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation, followed by a one-dimensional, second fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation to get a prediction for a binary classification problem. We use non-linear activation functions as the composition of linear functions is linear. Assume bias has not been merged. Let:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\bold{W}_1$ be the weights of the first layer, $\bold{b}_1$ be the bias of the first layer.
        \item $\bold{W}_2$ be the weights of the second layer, $\bold{b}_2$ be the bias of the second layer.
    \end{itemize}
    
    The described architecture can be written mathematically as: $$\hat{y} = \sigma(\bold{W}_2 \left[\sigma \left(\bold{W}_1 \bold{x} + \bold{b}_1\right)\right] + \bold{b}_2)$$
    
    where $\hat{y}$ is a scalar output of the net when passing in the single datapoint $\bold{x}$ (represented as a column vector), the additions are element wise additions, and the sigmoid is an element wise sigmoid.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $N$ be the number of datapoints we have
            \item $M$ be the dimensionality of the data
            \item $H$ be the size of the hidden dimension of the first layer. Here, hidden dimension is used to describe the dimension of the resulting value after going through the layer. Based on the problem description, the hidden dimension of the second layer should be 1.
        \end{itemize}
        
        Write out the dimensionality of each of the parameters, and of the intermediate variables:
  
            \begin{align*}
            \bold{a}_1 &= \bold{W}_1 \bold{x} + \bold{b}_1, 
            &\bold{z}_1 = \sigma(\bold{a}_1) \\
            a_2 &= \bold{W}_2 \bold{z}_1 + \bold{b}_2, 
            &\hat{y} = z_2 = \sigma(a_2)
            \end{align*}
            
        and make sure they work with the mathematical operations described above. Examining shapes is one of the key ways to debug your code, and can be done using .shape after any numpy array.
        
        \item  We will derive the gradients for each of the parameters, which can then be used along with gradient descent to find weights that improve our model's performance. For this question, assume there is only one datapoint $\bold{x}$, and that our loss is $L = -(y \log (\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log (1 - \hat{y}))$. For all questions, the chain rule will be useful.
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item Find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_2}$. 
          
          \item Find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_2^h}$, where $W_2^h$ represents the $h$th element of $\bold{W}_2$.
          
          \item Find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_1^h}$, where $b_1^h$ represents the $h$th element of $\bold{b}_1$. (*Hint: Note that only the $h$th element of $\bold{a}_1$ and $\bold{z}_1$ depend on $b_1^h$ - this should help you with how to use the chain rule.)
          
          \item Find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_1^{h,m}}$, where  $W_1^{h,m}$ represents the element in row $h$, column $m$ in $\bold{W}_1$.
      
      \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\end{problem}

\newpage 

\begin{framed}
    \noindent\textbf{Problem 2} (cont.)\\
    \begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{2}
    
      \item  We now explore an example of forward-mode auto-differentiation. Consider the following 
          equation:
    
          $$
            f(x_1, x_2) = \ln (\sin (x_1)) + x_1 \exp \{ x_2 \}
          $$
    
          This equation can be split up using intermediate variables $v_1, \dots, v_7$ as follows:
    
          \begin{align*}
            v_1 &= x_1 \\ 
            v_2 &= \sin (v_1) \\
            v_3 &= \ln (v_2) \\
            v_4 &= x_2 \\
            v_5 &= \exp \{ v_4 \} \\
            v_6 &= v_1v_5 \\
            v_7 &= v_3 + v_6 \\
            f(x_1, x_2) &= v_7
          \end{align*}
    
            Splitting up the equation like this is very similar to what an auto-differentiation 
            library would do. From these equations we can construct a \textit{computational graph} 
            where each node of the graph corresponds to an input, an intermediate variable, or 
            the output. 
    
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Let $x_1 = \frac{\pi}{6}$ and $x_2 = 1$. Calculate the values of all the 
                intermediate variables $v_1, \dots v_7$ and $f(x_1,x_2)$. 
            \item Calculate the derivative of
                all of the intermediate variables $v_1, \dots, v_7$ and
                $f$ with respect to $x_1$ evaluated 
                at $x_1 = \frac{\pi}{6}$ and $x_2 = 1$.  
    
        \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Extra Credit (Hard):} Consider two neural networks $f_1$ and $f_2$ for binary 
        classification. They each take in inputs $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and output a 
        prediction $\hat{y} \in [0,1]$. $f_1$
        consists of a single hidden layer with 4 nodes, each with 
        a ReLU activation function. These nodes are connected to a single sigmoid output node. Thus 
        $f_1$ has the following form:
    
        $$
        f_1(x) = \sigma\left( W_2[ReLU(W_1 x + b_1)] + b_2 \right)
        $$
    
        $f_2$ consists of 2 hidden layers, each with 2 ReLU activated nodes. Just as in $f_1$, the 
        nodes of the final layer are connected to a single sigmoid output node. 
        Thus $f_2$ has the following form:
    
        $$
        f_2(x) = \sigma(W_3[ReLU(W_2[ReLU(W_1 x + b_1)]+b_2)]+ b_3)
        $$
    
        We leave finding the shapes of the weight and bias vectors up to you, noting that 
        by convention $x$ should be considered a column vector with 2 elements. 
    
        Draw a classification boundary that $f_2$ can express but $f_1$ cannot and argue 
        why $f_2$ can express the boundary but $f_1$ cannot.

\part{a} Letting $x_1=\pi/6, \quad x_2=1$, we calculate the intermediate values:

\begin{align*}
  v_1 &= \frac{\pi}{6} \\
  v_2 &= \sin(\pi/6) = 0.5 \\
  v_3 &= \ln(1/2) = -\ln(2) \approx -0.693\\
  v_4 &= 1 \\
  v_5 &= e^1 = e \\
  v_6 &= x1\cdot e = \frac{\pi}{6}e \approx 1.423 \\
  v_7 &= v_3+v_6 = -\ln(2) + \frac{\pi}{6}e \approx 0.730

\begin{problem}[Modern Deep Learning Tools: PyTorch]

In this problem, you will learn how to use PyTorch. This machine learning library is massively popular and used heavily throughout industry and research. 


\begin{enumerate}
    \item In \verb|T3_P3.ipynb| you will implement an MLP for image classification from scratch. Paste your code solutions below and include a final graph of your training progress. Also submit your completed \verb|T3_P3.ipynb| file.
    \item Discuss what trends you see with your plot (train/test loss and train/test accuracy).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Out of Distribution (OOD) Analysis}: Now, let's evaluate the usefulness of the predictive uncertainties of our model for test data that are dissimilar to our training data. These test data points are called out of distribution (OOD) points. Just as in Homework 2, we want the predictive uncertainties from our models to help us distinguish in-distribution test data (test data that are similar to data on which we trained our model) and OOD test data. Again, in many safety-critical applications of ML, we want human-experts to override model decisions if the model is operating on extremely unfamiliar data. 

\hspace{3mm} 3. Report both the in and out distribution test accuracies of your model. In a couple of sentences, discuss what you notice about these accuracies.

\begin{problem}[Impact Question: Testing security of neural networks deployed in autonomous vehicles and suggesting policy recommendations (9 points)]

\textbf{The learning goal of the impact questions of this homework is
three-fold: }

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Get trained in adversarial thinking to be able to anticipate risks and
  possible exploits when designing Machine Learning applications
\item
  Understand opportunities and limitations to safety and security of
  Machine Learning applications
\item
  Learn to put yourself in the shoes of policymakers who are in charge
  of ensuring safety of real-world Machine Learning applications.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Prompt: }You are the Director of Machine Learning of the US
Department of Transportation (a federal US government agency).

The Secretary of the US Department of Transportation declares security
of Machine Learning applications deployed in autonomous vehicles as one
of the priorities of the agency. You are tasked to assess the security
of Machine Learning systems deployed in autonomous vehicles and develop
policy recommendations for the US Department of Transportation.

\textbf{Context: }Tesla employs Neural Networks for perception and
control tasks: For example semantic segmentation, object detection and
monocular depth estimation is performed by Neural Networks on images
captured with the car's camera system to identify road signs, traffic
lights, pedestrians, cars or other traffic related individuals,
vehicles, and objects. The full build autopilot consists of more than 48
networks which must identify high-risk scenarios and provide robust
predictions to ensure safety.

Moreover, beyond cameras Tesla also uses additional sensor systems such
as LiDAR or ultrasonic sensors. Yet, Tesla's engineering and design
approaches are still iterated and their software gets updated.

\subsection*{Solution:}

\question{4.1}{Adversarial thinking.} 

TODO

\part{a} An example of a hardware adversarial attack would be spraying paint or otherwise covering the camera of the self-driving car, or by placing tape over stop signs to make them look rectangular and to remove the word ``STOP." Making the camera unable to function (especially if done after the car was already in motion) would make the car unable to follow the rules of the road and avoid objects like cars or people. Physically making the stop sign unrecognizable would also likely lead to a crash from the autonomous vehicle hitting another car at a 4-way stop, because the rectangular stop sign would be pretty OOD compared to the input data used to train the model.

\part{b} An example of a software adversarial attack (assuming we nefariously gain access to the model prior to deployment) would be to  (TODO: what is this?) 

Another idea would be painting new lane markings that would lead the autopiloted car into oncoming traffic.

\part{c} An example of a social engineering attack could be if images/video used to train the neural network were purposefully polluted with mislabeled data or incorrect ``appropriate actions" (e.g. making red mean go and green mean stop at a stoplight).

\question{4.2}{Safeguards.} 
TODO

To protect against someone physically disabling the camera, Tesla could make the autopilot feature automatically turn off if any of its sensors are below some threshold of `optimum' (e.g. 95\%). This would allow for specs of dirt but not for disabling issues.

To protect against issues like weirdly made-up stop signs or paint on the road, the NN needs to be trained to recognize odd/abnormal markings. This would involve augmenting the training dataset to include such issues as construction, adversarial actors changing road signs, etc.

To protect against mislabeled or otherwise inappropriate data, the engineers need to actually examine the training dataset images. This is especially important for classification or ID tasks that involve high-risk or high-impact decisions (e.g. it's less important to know the meaning of one obscure sign than it is to identify when a human or car is within striking distance).
